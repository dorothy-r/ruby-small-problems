Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the
array occurs twice (every other value occurs exactly once), how would you
determine which value occurs twice? Write a method that will find and return
the duplicate value that is known to be in the array.

# Problem:
Input: an array
Output: one element from the array (integer)
In the example, the array is full of integers. Should this work for other data
types, or just numbers/integers?
Let's assume just integers for now.
There is only one duplicate value. Every other element is unique.
Return the duplicate value.

# Example:
find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
          38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
          14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
          78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
          89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
          41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
          55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
          85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
          40, 23, 71, 62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
          7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73

# Data Structures:
Input: array
Output: integer
Not sure if it would be helpful to use another array in the interim

# Algorithm:
Iterate through the array:
select the items that occur more than once
return one of those items

=end

# My solution
def find_dup(array)
  duplicate = 0
  array.each do |elem|
    duplicate = elem if array.count(elem) > 1
  end
  duplicate
end

# LS solution
def find_dup(array)
  array.find { |element| array.count(element) == 2}
end

puts find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
